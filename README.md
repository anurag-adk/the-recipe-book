# The Recipe Book

"The Recipe Book" is a console-based application developed in C allowing users to manage and organize their recipes efficiently. It provides a user-friendly text-based interface. The application uses three separate CSV files to store recipe details, ingredients and cooking steps, ensuring efficient data organization and retrieval. 

Key features include search functionality, modular design for code reusability and a "Surprise Cooking" option to inspire culinary exploration.

## Features

### CRUD
- Add new recipes with detailed information including recipe name, ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.
- View an organized list of all stored recipes and access comprehensive details for each.
- Modify existing recipes ensuring the recipes are up-to-date and personalized.
- Remove recipes that are no longer needed to maintain an organized and streamlined recipe book.

### Search
- Search for recipes by their names.
- Quickly find specific recipes within the collection.

### Surprise Cooking
- Receive a randomly selected recipe from the collection.
- Challenge yourself to make that dish and expand your culinary skills.

## Data Management

The application uses three separate CSV files to store different aspects of recipes:
1. **Recipe-Details.csv**: Stores the recipe name and general details.
2. **Recipe-Ingredients.csv**: Stores the list of ingredients for each recipe.
3. **Recipe-Steps.csv**: Stores the step-by-step cooking instructions.

This modular approach enhances data organization, making it easy to update and retrieve specific information without affecting other parts of the application.
